#### Gulpfile.js

lyui is built with Gulp, a build tool that compiles our CSS, JS, and docs with ease. You’ll need to install Node.js and Gulp before using our included gulpfile.js.

To install Node visit [https://nodejs.org/download](https://nodejs.org/download/).

To install gulp, run the following command:

```
$ npm install gulp -g
```

When you’re done, install the rest of the theme's dependencies:

```
$ npm install
```


#### Gulp Tasks

The two tasks immediately useful for you are `$ gulp` and `$ gulp docs`.

+ `gulp` - recompiles and minifies your theme assets.


#### Support

If you experience any problems with the above, or if you think you've found a bug with lyui- please don't hesitate to reach out to admin@lingyun.net. thanks!
